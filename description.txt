Multiverse 2 allows Server Owners and Solo Players to add "Subworlds" to their World, Similar to the Multiverse Plugin for Minecraft.

For players and server admins:
To add a subworld, just go into your config on either the server or your client depending if you are in singleplayer or not
and add a new entry in the `Worlds` list. change the name and choose the generator you want for your subworld. 
To enter a subworld, type `/mvtp subworldname` in the chat
if the world was added by another mod and was not generated by Multiverse 2, then type `/mvtp modname/subworldname`

For developers wanting to add their own generators: 
Just subclass ModGenerator and override `List<GenPass> GenPasses(int seed);` to add the gen passes.
